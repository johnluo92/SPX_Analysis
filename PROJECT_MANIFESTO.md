# ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT MANIFESTO

## THE GOAL
Build systematic premium-selling infrastructure to achieve financial independence through consistent income generation over years, not quarters.

## THE PROBLEM: Execution Failure

**You have the tool. You don't trust it.**

### PEP Example (Real Pain Point)
- **System:** IC90 (74% containment), IV +62% elevated
- **You:** "Premium not rich enough" â†’ skipped trade
- **Result:** Second-guessed the system, missed opportunity
- **Root cause:** Discretion overriding systematic analysis

### The Pattern
- Under-allocate when you should add risk (fear/perfectionism)
- Over-allocate when momentum feels good (greed/confidence)
- Override proven backtests with "gut feel"
- Regret the discretionary decisions

**Core issue:** Fighting the system instead of using it.

---

## THE SOLUTION: Systematic Strategy + Discretionary Sizing

**System decides WHAT to trade:**
- IC90/IC45 â†’ Sell iron condor
- BIASâ†‘/BIASâ†“ â†’ Directional spread  
- SKIP â†’ No edge

**Discretion decides HOW MUCH:**
- Below 55-month MA â†’ Increase position size
- IV â‰¥15% elevated â†’ Full premium sale
- IV â‰¤-15% depressed â†’ Reduce or skip
- Multiple signals aligned â†’ Max conviction sizing

**No discretion on strategy.** Trust the 24-quarter backtest, not today's feeling.

## WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ… (v2.5 - Current)
**Capabilities:**
- Historical pattern recognition (containment, bias, drift)
- Fast batch analysis (10-14 tickers/sec, 0 wasted API calls)
- Strike width recommendations
- IV context (elevated/depressed premium)

**Limitations:**
- No position sizing calculator
- No trade entry/exit specifications
- No portfolio risk tracking
- No performance feedback loop

---

### Phase 2: Execution Layer (Next)
**Build the bridge from analysis â†’ action:**

1. **Position Sizing Calculator**
   - Input: Account size, risk tolerance, ticker signal
   - Output: Exact position size (contracts, capital allocation)
   - Factor: Below 55-MA increases weight

2. **Trade Specification Tool**
   - Input: Ticker + strategy (IC90, BIASâ†‘)
   - Output: Exact strikes, DTE, entry price targets
   - Removes decision fatigue at execution

3. **Execution Checklist**
   - System says IC? â†’ Sell it (no override)
   - Size appropriately based on context
   - Document any deviation with reason

---

### Phase 3: Learning System (Vision)
**Close the feedback loop:**
- Track: System recommendation vs actual trade vs outcome
- Measure: Follow rate, override accuracy, P&L attribution
- Learn: Build conviction through evidence, not emotion
- Goal: "I followed 80% of signals â†’ profitable" â†’ trust increases

---

## ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

**Test Small â†’ Verify â†’ Scale:**
- 5 tickers before 38
- One file at a time
- Clear cache before tests
- Cross-platform verification

**Preserve What Works:**
- Earnings cache (API credits are sacred)
- Core calculations (proven accurate)
- Don't fix what isn't broken

**Question â†’ Commit:**
- Is data reliable? (No? â†’ Remove or warn clearly)
- Does this aid execution? (No? â†’ Cut it)
- One incremental improvement per session

---

## EXECUTION RULES

**Rule 1: Trust the Backtest**
- 24 quarters of data > today's gut feeling
- System says IC90 â†’ sell the condor (no debate)

**Rule 2: Discretion = Sizing Only**
- Below 55-MA? â†’ Bigger position
- IV elevated? â†’ Full size
- Multiple signals? â†’ Max conviction
- Strategy override? â†’ **NO**

**Rule 3: Document Deviations**
- Skipped a signal? Write why
- Track outcome
- Learn from data, not regret

**Rule 4: Compound Consistently**
- Premium every earnings season
- Small consistent > big sporadic
- Marathon, not sprint

---

## SUCCESS DEFINITION

**1 Year:**
- 20+ earnings plays per quarter
- 70%+ strategy win rate
- Trust system > second-guess system

**5 Years:**
- Substantial account (6-7 figures)
- Systematic process (repeatable, teachable)
- Financial independence achieved

**The Real Win:**
Reliable income generation that works while you sleep. Freedom through discipline.

## YOUR NEXT TRADE

**Before entry, answer:**
1. What does the tool say? (IC/BIAS/SKIP)
2. Is IV favorable? (Elevated/Normal/Depressed)
3. Risk sizing factors? (Below 55-MA, conviction level)
4. Am I overriding the system? (If yes, write WHY and track outcome)

---

## THE TRUTH

The tool is built. The backtests are done. The system works.

**Your job:** Execute the signals with appropriate sizing. Trust the work. Track the results. Build the future.

*"We can build the best tool there is, but if we don't use it, then what is the point?"*

**â†’ Use it. Trust it. Execute it.**

**Version:** 2.5 (Foundation)
