SESSION HANDOFF - October 11, 2025 (Session 3)
STATUS: System Functional, IV Cache By Design
Quick Test Results (6 Tests)

✅ 5/6 Passed - Core system working
❌ 1/6 Failed - IV cache "corruption" (actually by design)
Time to run: ~10 seconds


THE IV CACHE "ISSUE" - Actually Not an Issue
What Happened
Test failed looking for fetched_at field in IV cache, but we intentionally removed it Friday night (Oct 9th) to prevent after-hours corruption.
The Strategy (Implemented Last Session):

Don't fetch IV outside market hours (9:30-4pm ET)
Use Thursday's clean data rather than Friday's potentially corrupt 15-min delayed data
This prevents cascading corruption into Plotly visualizations

Current cache: Oct 9th data (Thursday) - this is correct behavior for weekend
Why Test Failed
Test assumed fetched_at would always exist. It doesn't in the current IV cache strategy. Test needs update to handle this.

DECISIONS MADE THIS SESSION

✅ Created quick 6-test diagnostic (ran in notebook, not saved as file)
✅ Identified what works: Order preservation, edge counts, analysis pipeline
✅ Confirmed IV cache strategy: No fetching outside market hours (working as intended)
✅ Removed IV Landscape from future builds - You'll check ToS manually for IV richness, liquidity, spreads


NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
Build Timeless System Test
Goal: Periodic health check that runs in <30 seconds, catches regressions
What to test:

Core imports work
Analysis pipeline (2 tickers, no IV fetch)
Output structure (all columns present)
Edge count displays
Order preservation
Performance timing - How long each phase takes

What NOT to test:

❌ File system paths (cross-platform issues)
❌ IV cache fetched_at (removed by design)
❌ Plotly files (generated separately)

Add Performance Metrics
Track timing for:

Earnings data fetch per ticker
Price data fetch per ticker
Single ticker analysis duration
Batch analysis total time
IV fetch (if enabled)

Output format:
⏱️  PERFORMANCE:
  - Earnings fetch: 0.2s avg per ticker
  - Analysis: 1.5s avg per ticker
  - Total batch (5 tickers): 8.3s

WHAT WORKS (Confirmed This Session)
Core Functionality ✅

Pattern detection (IC45, IC90, BIAS↑/↓)
Edge counting: [1 edge], [2 edges], [3 edges]
45D and 90D columns both showing
Break ratios with arrows: 5:0↑, 3:2, 2:4↓
Drift calculations: +5.4%, +6.2%
Order preservation: Input order = Output order

Output Structure ✅

All expected columns present
Table width appropriate (145 chars)
Strategy display includes edge count
Key Takeaways section working


WHAT TO REMOVE (Confirmed)
IV Landscape Section
Reason: You're checking ToS for:

IV vs HVol richness
Options liquidity
Bid/ask spreads
Margin requirements

The tool can't compete with ToS for real-time options data - let it focus on historical pattern recognition.

INFRASTRUCTURE SOUND, READY TO FLOURISH
Code Stability

No files modified this session (diagnostic only)
Core calculations untouched
Order preservation verified
Edge counting verified

Next Phase Focus

Timeless system test - Quick periodic health check with timing
Performance tracking - Know where bottlenecks are
Gradual Phase 2 additions - Options chain, trade specs (future sessions)


FILES STATUS

Needs Update Next Session

quick_sanity_test.py - Make it timeless, add performance tracking, remove IV cache fetched_at check


OPEN ITEMS FOR NEXT SESSION

Build robust timeless test - <30s runtime, catches regressions, tracks performance
Remove IV Landscape from batch output (you'll use ToS instead)
Add performance timing to test output
Document IV cache weekend strategy in code comments
