# V1 Files Archive

**Archived on:** October 16, 2025

These files were replaced by V2 refactored versions.

## Archived Files

### Analysis (old batch processor)
- batch.py (19.5 KB)
- single.py (7.2 KB)

### Visualization (old matrix)
- quality_matrix.py (10.8 KB)

### Output (old formatters - duplicated in presentation)
- formatters.py (1.0 KB)

**Total:** 4 files, ~38.5 KB

## Why Archived?

V2 refactoring created cleaner versions:
- `batch.py` (400 lines) → `batch_v2.py` (50 lines)
- Separated concerns into specialized modules
- Added type safety with AnalysisResult
- Eliminated duplicate calculations

## V1 vs V2 Comparison

| Aspect | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| batch.py size | 400 lines | 50 lines |
| Concerns | Mixed | Separated |
| Type safety | None (dicts) | Full (AnalysisResult) |
| Duplicate calculations | Yes | No (cached) |
| Maintainability | Harder | Much easier |

## How to Restore

If you need to restore any file:

```bash
# Restore batch.py
cp earnings_analyzer/_archive_v1/analysis/batch.py earnings_analyzer/analysis/

# Restore single.py
cp earnings_analyzer/_archive_v1/analysis/single.py earnings_analyzer/analysis/

# Restore quality_matrix.py
cp earnings_analyzer/_archive_v1/visualization/quality_matrix.py earnings_analyzer/visualization/

# Restore formatters.py
cp earnings_analyzer/_archive_v1/output/formatters.py earnings_analyzer/output/
```

Then revert the `__init__.py` files from git:
```bash
git checkout earnings_analyzer/__init__.py
git checkout earnings_analyzer/analysis/__init__.py
git checkout earnings_analyzer/visualization/__init__.py
```

## Can I Delete This Archive?

Yes, after confirming V2 works in production for a few weeks.

The archive is just a safety backup. If no issues arise after 4+ weeks of using V2, you can safely delete this entire `_archive_v1/` directory.

## Files in Archive

```
_archive_v1/
├── analysis/
│   ├── batch.py
│   └── single.py
├── visualization/
│   └── quality_matrix.py
├── output/

└── README.md (this file)
```

## Next Steps

1. Update the 3 `__init__.py` files to remove V1 exports
2. Test that imports still work
3. Use V2 in production for 2-4 weeks
4. If no issues, delete this archive folder
