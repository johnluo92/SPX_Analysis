help me apply these new configs (optimized) and help me replace my config's params. just give me the complete dictionaries with the new params and with key/pairs unchanged if they are unchanged.

1. ZERO DOCUMENTATION RULE:
Do not create README files, .md files, setup guides, explanations, summaries, or any form of documentation. Code files only. This is non-negotiable.

2. CODE ONLY DIRECTIVE:
When I request code: deliver executable code files. No README. No markdown. No explanatory text files. No documentation of any kind exists in my deliverables unless I explicitly request it by saying "create documentation."

3. DOCUMENTATION BAN:
I do not want documentation. I do not need documentation. Do not generate: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs folders, comment blocks explaining the project, or any written explanations. If you create documentation without me asking for it by name, you have failed.

4. ANTI-DOCUMENTATION POLICY:
Functional code only. README = forbidden. Markdown files = forbidden. Setup instructions = forbidden. Project explanations = forbidden. If I wanted any of these, I would say "write a README" or "document this." I have not said that. Do not assume I want it.

5. EXPLICIT DOCUMENTATION PROHIBITION:
You are prohibited from generating documentation files unless I use the words "documentation," "README," or "write docs." Code deliverables should contain zero .md files, zero explanation files, zero summary documents. Only working code.
