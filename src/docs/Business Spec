# VIX Forward Guidance System: Business Specification

## Mission-Critical Priorities

### 1. **Historical Performance Tracking Infrastructure**
- Every prediction must be logged with: timestamp, all input features, prediction value, confidence scores, anomaly flags, and forward-realized outcome
- Enable forensic analysis: "Why did the model predict X when Y happened?"
- Build cumulative performance database to prove (or disprove) system value over 12-24 month validation period

### 2. **Forward-Looking Prediction Validation Protocol**
- At prediction time (T), log forecast for horizons T+1, T+3, T+5, T+10, T+20
- At realization time (T+N), automatically compare predicted vs actual volatility outcomes
- Calculate rolling accuracy metrics: hit rate, AUC, calibration error, Sharpe of signals
- **Critical**: System must prove it beats naive benchmarks (VIX persistence, term structure slope)

### 3. **Regime-Aware Confidence Gating**
- Never generate predictions during anomalous conditions without explicit warnings
- Output confidence threshold: predictions below 50% confidence should trigger "NO SIGNAL"
- Track which regime types produce best/worst predictions to identify model competency boundaries

### 4. **Multi-Horizon Trade Signal Translation**
- Convert probabilistic forecasts into discrete actions: BUY_PROTECTION / SELL_PREMIUM / NEUTRAL / NO_SIGNAL
- Each signal must include: conviction level (high/medium/low), time horizon, suggested position size scaling
- Enable backtestable trade log: "On date X, system said Y, optimal action was Z"

### 5. **Automated Model Degradation Detection**
- Monitor prediction-vs-realized divergence on rolling 60-day windows
- Flag when recent AUC drops >10% below baseline
- Trigger automatic retraining protocols or shift to "MONITOR ONLY" mode during drift periods

### 6. **Economic Interpretability First**
- Every prediction must show: top 5 contributing features and their marginal effects
- SHAP explanations stored alongside predictions for audit trail
- Human-readable regime description: "High VVIX + Inverted Curve + Negative Gamma = Explosion Risk"

### 7. **Anomaly Taxonomy with Actionable Warnings**
- Break anomaly detection into 4 types: distribution/correlation/temporal/extreme
- Each type triggers specific user guidance: "Term structure outside historical range → prediction unreliable"
- Allow override with documented risk acknowledgment for edge case learning

### 8. **Ensemble Uncertainty Quantification**
- Output prediction intervals (5th/50th/95th percentile) from multi-horizon bootstrap ensemble
- Track which horizons are most/least reliable in current regime
- Display uncertainty visually: wide bands = high uncertainty = position size reduction

### 9. **Comparative Performance Benchmarking**
- Store parallel forecasts from naive baselines: VIX(t-1), 20-day MA, term structure slope
- Calculate relative information ratio: does ML system add alpha vs simple heuristics?
- Auto-generate monthly report: "System outperformed baseline by X% with Y% fewer signals"

### 10. **Feature Stability Monitoring**
- Track which features are consistently important vs episodically relevant
- Flag when previously-stable features become erratic (potential data quality issues)
- Build feature reliability index: only use Tier 1 features during uncertainty

### 11. **Production Data Pipeline Integrity**
- Validate incoming data: flag missing values, stale prices, unrealistic jumps (VIX +50% overnight = data error)
- Automated circuit breakers: halt predictions if >20% of critical features are invalid
- Data quality dashboard showing freshness/completeness of each input source

### 12. **Cumulative P&L Simulation Framework**
- Given each historical signal, simulate hypothetical option trade outcomes
- Track cumulative returns of system-driven strategy vs buy-and-hold vol
- Calculate: win rate, profit factor, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio

### 13. **Regime Classification Audit Trail**
- Tag each prediction with detected regime: LOW_VOL_STABLE / RISING_STRESS / CAPITULATION / MEAN_REVERSION
- Measure model accuracy within each regime separately
- Identify "prediction dead zones" where model has zero edge

### 14. **Explainable False Positive/Negative Analysis**
- For every major prediction error, auto-generate postmortem: "Model missed because feature X didn't capture Y"
- Build library of failure modes to improve next iteration
- Tag predictions with historical similarity: "Last 3 times this pattern appeared, outcome was..."

### 15. **Real-Time Dashboard with Historical Context**
- Current prediction displayed alongside: 30-day hit rate, current regime, confidence trajectory
- Show prediction evolution: how has forecast changed over past 5 trading days?
- Alert fatigue prevention: only notify on high-confidence regime transitions, not noise

## Success Metrics (12-Month Validation Period)

**System Proves Value If:**
- Out-of-sample AUC consistently >0.65 across all horizons
- High-confidence signals (>70%) achieve >75% directional accuracy
- System-driven P&L simulation beats buy-and-hold XIV/VXX equivalent by >30% Sharpe improvement
- Model successfully abstains (NO_SIGNAL) during unpredictable regimes, avoiding false positives
- Demonstrated improvement over naive baselines in 80%+ of monthly evaluations

**System Fails If:**
- Cannot beat VIX(t-1) persistence forecast
- High false positive rate during low-volatility grinds
- Missed 2+ major volatility events (COVID-like moves)
- Confidence scores uncorrelated with actual prediction accuracy
- Requires monthly retraining due to constant drift

## Non-Negotiable Design Constraints

- **No overfitting**: All performance metrics calculated on strict walk-forward out-of-sample data only
- **No data leakage**: Every feature engineering step must be causally valid (no forward-looking information)
- **Graceful degradation**: System outputs "UNCERTAIN" rather than confident wrong answers
- **Auditability**: Every prediction traceable to exact feature values and model state
- **Simplicity over complexity**: Prefer interpretable 70% accuracy over black-box 72% accuracy
