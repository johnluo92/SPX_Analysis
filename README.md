data and pipeline set up for real-time disgestion

created for personal entertainment and for helping with my personal investing/trading

SPX's chart has a monte carlo simulation that is currently commented out but the histogram shows the distribution based on the natural log of historical returns based on daily closing prices for all historically available data on yahoo finance. When ran, the data will be uploaded from the latest date and charted with some key metrics.

The other chart is for the VIX, an industry standard volatility reading based on the options chains of the SPX index. It too refreshes but the there is no simulation, instead it shows the current reading in the grand scheme of constantly-refreshing dataset (daily closing). It presents a normal distribution to help with understanding the current level vs on a gaussian, albeit positively skewed.
